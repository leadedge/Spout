Title: List of senders

Creating your own sender list

A receiver can use "SelectSender" to open a sender selection dialog but this might not be appropriate for your application.

To create a list of senders for a menu or drop-down list, use the following process :


1) Get the sender count

GetSenderCount returns the number of Spout senders that are currently running.

--- Code
	int nSenders = receiver.GetSenderCount();
---


2) Get sender names

GetSender returns the name of a sender with an index into the list of senders. The default is length is 256 if not specified :

--- Code
	char SenderName[256];
	int index = 0; // based on GetSenderCount
	receiver.GetSender(index, SenderName);
---


3) Get sender details

GetSenderInfo returns the width, height, share handle and format of the DirectX 11 shared texture. For OpenGL you only need to specify the width and height.

--- Code
	unsigned int width, height;
	HANDLE hShareHandle;
	DWORD dwFormat;
	receiver.GetSenderInfo(SenderName, width, height, hShareHandle, dwFormat);
---

For example  :

--- Code
	char SenderName[256];
	int nSenders = myReceiver.GetSenderCount();
	if(nSenders > 0) {
		for(int index=0; index<nSenders; index++) {
			myReceiver.GetSender(index, SenderName);
			//
			// Do something here to create your list
			//
		}
	}
---


4) Set the active sender

When the user has selected a sender from your list, you may wish to set this sender as "active" in keeping with the function of the sender selection dialog "SelectSender".

--- Code
  receiver.SetActiveSender(SenderName);
---

Once set as active, this sender will be the one that a receiver first detects if a nominated sender is not found.


5) Indicating the active sender

After creating the selection list, you may wish to indicate to the user which sender is currently "active". "GetActiveSender" returns the name of the active sender. 

--- Code
	char SenderName[256];
	receiver.GetActiveSender(SenderName);
---

NOTE: There is no provision for the maximum number of bytes to be returned, so make sure you have prepared a receiving character array for the sender name of no less than 256 bytes in length.
